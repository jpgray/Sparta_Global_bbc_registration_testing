# Sparta_Global_bbc_registration_testing

This is a testing using Cucumber (with expressions, hooks, and tags), a Page Object Model and a data table to determine field entry. The test uses Selenium chromedriver to access the BBC website, and attempt to sign up. Using different forms of incorrect password will display different error messages. This test uses the data model to assess whether the website is displaying the appropriate error message for each invalid password.
